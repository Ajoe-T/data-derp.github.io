# Exercise: Real World Structured Streaming

Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/small-exercises/tree/master/real-world-structured-streaming) to get started.

## Need a little Scala booster?
This exercise is written in Scala (intentionally! See if you can identify why.). If you're not familar with Scala and just want a quick overview of the syntax, check out [this tutorial](https://www.scala-exercises.org/std_lib/asserts). 

You can also find [a very short Scala exercise](https://github.com/data-derp/small-exercises/tree/master/basic-scala) that is tailored for Scala functions specific to the Streaming exercise.
