# Data Milky Way: Concepts and Tools

## Latency
Relative to ‘humanized’ time, to give you an idea of the enormous difference
(demonstrates the massive impact of using memory vs disk vs network in Big Data)

* Gives you a feel for the latency nightmare when only using disk and network (i.e. MapReduce)
* Hopefully demonstrates the orders of magnitude in performance gain with Spark!



## But...
Okay, sounds like the OLAP world is in good hands...
But what about OLTP?
(i.e. databases for my live, transactional applications)?

## Distributed Data Systems
NoSQL Technologies

Read: [CAP Theorem](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cap-theorem#toc-the-cap-in-9y9p3uen)
**C** (consistency) **A** (availability) **P** (partition tolerance) : pick two
* [Is this really true in the real world?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SSvdLnmDiI&ab_channel=MarkRichards)
* What unrealistic assumption are we making here?
  * Can we really assume that network communications won’t fail?
  * Is there really such thing as a distributed system that won’t have partitions?
* Not a binary choice between C and A
* Several NoSQL solutions offer a tunable tradeoff between C and A
* Another overview

**Summary**
a CP system will say “sorry, I can’t be sure yet” to the client, in order to avoid giving an out-of-date answer

an AP system tries to spits out an answer even if it might not be the most up-to-date one

## OLTP Workloads
Big Data in OLTP is quite an advanced topic and has far less consolidation/standardization. The tech stacks for different problems/businesses vary a lot more than in OLAP workloads!

For the reasons above, we’ll focus on OLAP technologies for the rest of the course.
However, feel free to check out some common NoSQL technologies:


* [Amazon DynamoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVJXehUvYew&ab_channel=Serverless)
* [Azure CosmosDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGNBFiq1rg&ab_channel=MicrosoftAzure)
* Redis
* Elasticsearch
* [Cassandra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7o6a75sfY0&ab_channel=DataStaxDevelopers)
* [MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGfFpQF0NpE&ab_channel=MongoDB)
