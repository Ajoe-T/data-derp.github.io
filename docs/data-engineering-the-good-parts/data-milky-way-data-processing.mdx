## Evolution of Data Processing

* [Hadoop to Spark w/ Object Storage](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/apache-spark-vs-hadoop-mapreduce/), [Data Catalogs](https://lakefs.io/metadata-management-hive-metastore-vs-aws-glue/)
* [Batch and Micro-Batch Streaming](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/batch-stream-a-cheat-sheet)
* [Continuous Processing](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/stream-processing/)


[Apache Beam: One syntax to rule them all?](https://beam.apache.org/)
* Apache Beam is based on the [Dataflow model introduced by Google](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43864.pdf)
* Aims to unify the semantics of batch & streaming processing across engines (Flink, Spark, etc.)

**You donâ€™t necessarily need streaming, let alone Beam!** evaluate your own projectâ€™s needs
Advanced (optional): [Practice developing a Beam app in AWS Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/examples-beam.html)
Weâ€™ll mention Flink more in later sections ðŸŒ°


## Practical Data Workloads

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

Weâ€™re here to teach you big data skills, but in reality...

</div>

Single-Node vs. Cluster: not everything is Big Data!
[You donâ€™t always need Spark](https://www.indellient.com/blog/a-journey-from-pandas-to-spark-data-frames/)
([sometimes Pandas deployed on a single node function/container is just fine!](https://www.indellient.com/blog/a-journey-from-pandas-to-spark-data-frames/))

Batch vs Streaming: [streaming isnâ€™t always the solution](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/batch-processing-vs-stream-processing/)!

Batch Orchestration options
* [CRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), Triggers (e.g. AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, [Glue Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/trigger-job.html))
* Simple CRON schedules (e.g. on Databricks) might work just fine, depends on the use-case

## Typical Data Pipeline

## Orchestration Core Concepts
But how do we make our pipeline **flow**? ðŸŒŠ
* Data Engineering workflows often involve transforming and transferring data from one place to another
* Workflows in real-life have multiple steps and stages


* Sometimes, everything might work fine with just CRON jobs
* However, other times, you might want to control the state transitions of these steps:
  * e.g. if Step A doesnâ€™t run properly, donâ€™t run Step B because the data could be corrupt, instead run Step C
  * Once again, the concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) can come to our rescue

* Apache Airflow is just one nice way of setting up DAGs to orchestrate jobs ðŸŒˆ
  * Note: Airflow is primarily designed as a task orchestration tool
  * You can trigger tasks on the Airflow cluster itself or on remote targets (e.g. AWS Fargate, Databricks, etc.)
  * NOT designed for transferring large amounts of actual data
  * Reference
  * Play around with Airflow locally
