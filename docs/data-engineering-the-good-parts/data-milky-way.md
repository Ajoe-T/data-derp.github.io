Choice is driven by Business Needs
When do I need this data?
How many people need this data?
How many different ways do I want to visualize the data?
How much does it cost me to maintain?

## Data Milky Way - Databases & Data Warehouses 
Databases: Scale Up vs Scale Out
Up until the mid-late 2000s, businesses predominantly stored both OLTP and OLAP data in relational databases (RDBMS)
e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
OLAP-oriented databases for storing large amounts of data were called Data Warehouses
Relational databases were notoriously difficult to distribute/scale out
As more data came in, businesses often opted to scale up ðŸ’°
Greater investment risk
Difficult to plan capacity
Expensive
Restrictive limits to CPU & memory
for a single server


Data Warehouses required careful upfront planning
Schema and layout need to be decided beforehand
Query patterns/use-cases needed to be preempted
