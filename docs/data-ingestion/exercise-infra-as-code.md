# Infrastructure as Code
![project-structure-ingestion-navi.png](./assets/project-structure-ingestion-navi.png)

Creating resources in the AWS Console can be sometimes prone to mistakes, but we have [Infrastructure as Code](https://infrastructure-as-code.com/book/) to the rescue.

The Terraform code to bring up our infrastructure can be found [here].

**Optional:** Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-infrastructure#infrastructure-as-code) to use Terraform to create these resources. 
* You might need to manually delete the resources you created by hand to prevent resource clashing. 
* Don't forget to destroy your resources when you're done!
