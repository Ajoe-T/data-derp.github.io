# Exercise: Production Code

Now that you've created the ingestion logic in Databricks, let's see what that logic looks like in production code.

1. Watch the following video below to get an overview of the Production Code
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <figure class="video-container">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1pZQSVismnU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </figure>
    </div>

2. Watch the following video below to get an overview of the CI/CD components
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
   
    <figure class="video-container">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdlRtYavCGk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </figure>
    </div>

3. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-production-code#quickstart) to walk through the production code and set up the CI/CD pipeline (switch to the `solutions` branch). You will need to use the pipeline to create the data-ingestion artifacts to use in the next exercise.

## Notes
* Switch to the `solutions` branch.
* The logic is identical to the [previous Databricks exercise](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-databricks#data-ingestion)
