# Exercise: Production Code

Now that you've created the ingestion logic in Databricks, let's see what that logic looks like in production code (switch to the `solutions` branch). Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-production-code#quickstart) to see the entire project in action, including the CI/CD pipeline for the **data ingestion** section.

## Notes
* Switch to the `solutions` branch.
* The logic is identical to the [previous Databricks exercise](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-databricks#data-ingestion)
