# Introduction

## How we got to Data Mesh
Data Mesh is a paradigm shift in analytical data management at scale. It came in response to the emerging pattern where
there was a widening gap between data consumers and producers. The gap between data consumers and producers is often caused by 
a lack of data domain alignment, and siloed work between data sources, analytical teams, and data consumers. 

#### What led to this gap? 



#### Some of the symptoms seen as a result of these patterns:
- difficulty onboarding new data sources in a timely manner
- inability to scale to meet consumer needs / use cases
- tech-initiatives driven within siloes instead of being centred on use cases fail to be bootstrapped
- unable to realise data-driven value
