# Overview

## How we got to Data Mesh
Data Mesh is a paradigm shift in analytical data management at scale. It came in response to the pattern which was emerging,
of having a gap between data consumers and producers. The gap between data consumers and producers is often caused by 
a lack of data domain alignment, and siloed work between data sources, analytical teams, and data consumers. 

Some of the symptoms seen as a result of these patterns are:
- difficulty onboarding new data sources in a timely manner
- inability to scale to meet consumer needs / use cases
- tech-initiatives driven within siloes instead of being centred on use cases fail to be bootstraped
- unable to realise data-driven value

## The Data Mesh approach
We've now covered some of the practises and failure patterns that highlighted the need for a different way to treat data 
and the ownership of data in the analytical space. 

The approach aims to address some of these issues through the application of the following four principles:
- [Domain-driven ownership of data](#principle-1)
- [Treating data as a product](#principle-2)
- [Enabling data owners with a self-serve data platform](#principle-3)
- [Federated, computational data governance](#principle-4)

### Domain-driven ownership of data

Data should be managed close to its soruce of origin. Data Mesh achieves this through a distributed domain driven
architecture which aligns data with the domain boundaries of an organisation.  This allows us to scale, by moving 
away from monolithic analytical archtiectures / team structures which can become a bottleneck, and close the gap
between data producers and their consumers. It also helps to establish proper ownership and accountability for data.
