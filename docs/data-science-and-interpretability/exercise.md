# Exercise

> TODO: move this to a better place?

We recommend you to do this exercise after you’ve watched the videos on Streaming
(specifically the Kafka 101 playlist)

Check out this [tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/build-and-test-your-first-machine-learning-model-using-python-and-scikit-learn/)

* Download the [notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ml-learning-path-assets/master/notebooks/classification_start_to_end_with_scikit_learn.ipynb) as an .ipynb file here
* Try running on Google Colab (rather than on IBM Cloud)
* But don’t forget to Restart the Runtime after installing those specific libraries
* Understand why you have to encode categorical variables
* Understand why you have to split train and test data
* In practice, the train-test split is more like 70-30 or 80-20
  * (98-2 is a bit bizarre)
