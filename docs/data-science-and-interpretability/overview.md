### Supervised Learning
* Classification
  * Binary:
    * should this loan be approved?
    * Is this a picture of a cat or a dog?
  * Multi-class: what bird species is this picture?
* Regression
  * Many-to-one:
    * Predicting the price of a second-hand car
  * Many-to-many:
    * Forecasting sales for the next 3 months

### Unsupervised Learning
* Clustering, Topic Modelling
* Dimensionality Reduction

### Optimization & Reinforcement Learning
* Convex Optimization, Genetic Algorithms 
* Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Intuition

What are some limitations of linear models (y = mx + b)? or even multiple linear regression (y = m1x1 + m2x2 + â€¦ + b)?
* Assumes **monotonic gradient (slope)** between the target variable (y) and any feature (e.g. x1)
* Assumes **constant slope steepness** between the target variable (y) and any feature (e.g. x1)
  for the entire domain of that feature

Machine Learning models can often provide the **flexibility** to overcome this. Think of it as **automatic curve fitting** and **if-else**!
  * You donâ€™t need to hard-code the predicates
  * The algorithm will determine and optimize your if-conditions

However, note the issue happening with the green line in the picture ðŸ˜µ

## Data Science
### Trade-offs in modelling
![underfitting-overfitting.png](./assets/underfitting-overfitting.png)
![accuracy-vs-intelligibility.png](./assets/accuracy-vs-intelligibility.png)

* Flexibility vs Generalization
* Overfitting vs Underfitting 
  * How can we avoid overfitting in particular?
* Complexity vs Interpretability
  * Is that dichotomy still strictly true today?


### Modelling in the real world
![confidence-intervals.png](./assets/confidence-intervals.png)
* ML & Deep Learning training
  * can be expensive and difficult to debug, start simple!
* Explainability
* Are point estimates always enough?
* some stakeholders require [uncertainties / confidence intervals](https://machinelearningmastery.com/uncertainty-in-machine-learning/)

### What problem are you actually trying to solve?
![roc-curve.png](./assets/roc-curve.png)
![true-class-predicted-class.png](./assets/true-class-predicted-class.png)

* Machine Learning models optimize for a single objective function
  * [Pick the appropriate objective!](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall)
    * Are False Positives or False Negatives most detrimental to business and/or society?
    * If so, balance it with â€˜overall accuracyâ€™
* Communicate with business & stakeholders
* Evaluate holistically, not just with one metric
  * Classification examples
    * [Confusion matrix](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/true-false-positive-negative)
    * [ROC and AUC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc), ([detailed, clearly explained video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRBRDbJemM&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer))
  * Regression examples
    * [Error distributions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics)

## Interpretability
![i-am-dog.png](./assets/i-am-dog.png)

Why is interpretability crucial?
* Safety & accountability
* Fairness & bias
* Regulatory compliance
* Security
  * Adversarial attacks
