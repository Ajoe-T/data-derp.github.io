![project-structure-transformation-navi.png](./assets/project-structure-transformation-navi.png)

For this exercise, we will work in Databricks. We'll be using Databricks because we can provide a narrative of the logic and walk through the logic together. It also makes learning the Spark API super easy! [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature#data-transformation) to get started.
