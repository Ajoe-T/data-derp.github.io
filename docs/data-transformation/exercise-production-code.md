# Exercise: Production Code
![project-structure-transformation-navi.png](./assets/project-structure-transformation-navi.png)

Now that you've created the transformation logic in Databricks, let's see what that logic looks like in production code (switch to the `solutions` branch). You have already done most of the [setup](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-production-code#quickstart) from the previous section on **Data Ingestion**. Let's look at the code for **Data Transformation**

## Notes
* Switch to the `solutions` branch.
* The logic is identical to the [previous Databricks exercise](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-databricks#data-transformation)
