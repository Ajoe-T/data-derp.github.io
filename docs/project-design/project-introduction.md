# Project Introduction

![project-structure-navi.png](./assets/project-structure-navi.png)

We'll take **Example 1: Jess** as our core use case for our project.

For this training, our goal is to study the relationship between CO2 and Temperature around the world. Some questions that we aim to answer:
* Which countries are worse-hit (higher temperature anomalies)?
* Which countries are the biggest emitters?
* What are some attempts of ranking “biggest polluters” in a sensible way?

Since we are analysing trends on historical data, we have the following landmarks to help us on our data journey:
* Data Source
* Ingestion - Batch ingest
* Transformation
* Visualisation - via a notebook

The above figure represents what our final state will be. In the next few lessons, we'll pull this apart like an onion and put it back together again.
