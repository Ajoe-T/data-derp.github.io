# Exercise: Core Logic

The first point of entry to doing Data Engineering is first getting your data or **Ingesting** it. For this first exercise (Data Ingestion), we will work in Databricks. We'll be using Databricks because we can provide a narrative of the logic and walk through the logic together. It also makes learning the Spark API super easy! [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature-databricks/tree/master/data-ingestion) to get started.

(**NOTE:** the video mentions the Community Edition. But we recommend using Databricks Pro.)
