# Python
This training uses Python and is therefore recommended that you have a grasp on the language for an improved learning experience. If you have any doubts about your level or if you're not all that familiar with Python (but feel like you shouldn't have an issue picking up the language on-the-fly), you can do walk through this exercise to self-check your Python comfort level!
